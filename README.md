# mini-projects
This repository contains small, interactive features and mini-projects that I made during my journey of learning JavaScript.

Many of these features can be fun to use in a game. The "Dark and Light Mode" toggle button is a basic and very widely used features in many websites. 
Hope you like it, Happy Coding!
